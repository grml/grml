# Release Kick-Off

- [ ] decide: "New release" codename: Link to comment in https://github.com/grml/gsa-doc/issues/8 (*Comment: update the issue, but don't leak here üòâ*)
- [ ] decide: "Next release" codename: Link to comment in https://github.com/grml/gsa-doc/issues/8 (*Comment: update the issue, but dont' leak here üòâ*)

  * https://deb.grml.org/dists/grml-live/main/binary-amd64/Packages + https://deb.grml.org/dists/grml-live/main/binary-arm64/Packages + https://deb.grml.org/dists/grml-live/main/binary-i386/Packages need to be empty
